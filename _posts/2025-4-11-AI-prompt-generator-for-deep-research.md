## Introduction - Yes, this blog is not dead yet!

Hello everyone,

It feels like it’s been a while! Work and the usual deadlines have kept me busy, but I've missed sharing things here and I'm committed to keeping this space active. I’m genuinely excited to be back, especially because I want to share something I’ve found incredibly useful lately.

If you've ever wrestled with AI tools for deep research, you might find this interesting. I want to introduce you to a tool that significantly shifted my perspective and results: [Feedough’s AI Prompt Generator](https://www.feedough.com/ai-prompt-generator/).

## My Past Struggles with AI for Deep Research

For some time, I’ve found deep research tools challenging. The main problem was they often give inaccurate or irrelevant results, especially when looking into really specialized topics. These topics need deep knowledge, not just general info, and I noticed the results weren't precise enough. After trying the tool in different ways, the rate of bad outputs was just higher than I wanted.

So I decided to just use deep research as a take-more-time-and-effort search (at least deepresearch gives you back the links for what they found so ye... its not that bad in this case).

## My friend changed my mind

> Shoutout to you - my friend Saber. Always feel great to have deep conversations with you.

So one of my friends, who is pursuing an AI Researcher career, showed me some of his work related to AI-as-a-mentor. So this is an interesting way to use AI, but ye, my experience told me that is not that great...

But anyway, after some deep thoughts and discussions with him, I decided to try some use cases for AI that I deeply believe they are unreliable. One of them was deep research.
## Trying Deep Research Again (and Failing lol)
So recently, I used DeepResearch again as a tool to find papers related to some super-secret-that-I-can-not-tell-you topic. And its kind of "edge". DeepResearch failed me so badly in this case. So I decided to manually search for papers, and that gave me much more useful results!!!

As I said, after some deep talks with my friend and some rethinking about DeepResearch, I decided maybe I should improve my prompt.

So before you said anything, my prompt was quite detailed before. Not some "find me a paper" prompt. But I tried to improve it more and more.

> Maybe some posts in the future about this. Believe me, I have some interesting ~~beliefs~~ base knowledge and practical experience about this so I decided to not over-improve my prompt!

So I made some basic changes to my prompt and its still incredibly bad, lmao :)).

That's when I decided to search for some tools that could help me improve my prompt. And I found this tool: [Feedough’s AI Prompt Generator](https://www.feedough.com/ai-prompt-generator/).

## My experience with Feedough’s AI Prompt Generator
So I simply feed it my old prompt, and it gave me a new prompt, which I will say was longer and more detailed. I just simply copied and pasted it into DeepResearch. And guess what? It worked! I got some papers that are related to my topic.

Not believe that? Ye, you should try yourself rather than just believe me.

But here is my case:

+ My topic is rather edge as I said above.
+ Old prompt is not that bad.
+ Old prompt gave me 20-30 papers, only 0-1 of them was related and useful for me.
+ Fed the old prompt into Feedough’s AI Prompt Generator, got the new one.
+ New prompt gave me 50-60 papers, 2-3 of them were super useful, 4-5 of them were related and relatively useful.

Okay, about precision-wise, its not improve that much, but about recall-wise, its much much much better than the old prompt!!!

In my case (or edge researching in general), this result is incredible :).

## Conclusion
So this post is just about sharing (and keeping this blog alive haha). I hope you find it useful.

Feel free to share your experience with me. I’m always open to learning and improving my skills!
