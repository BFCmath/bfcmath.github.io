## Introduction

Hi all, it’s been a week since my last post, and I’m back with something cool! Today, I want to share with you guys a nice use case of AI that I think researchers will be really excited about: technical writing. 

I recently joined an AI competition about a niche problem. Some crazy research and engineering stuff happened, but I won’t cover that here. Instead, I want to share how I used [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) to write the technical report in just 3 hours!

## The Competition

This AI competition was challenging, not gonna lie. It had a ton of strict constraints and threw me into a new domain I don’t know that much about. I spent nearly a month researching and developing results, pouring my heart into it. The results aren’t out yet—there are still more rounds to go—but the organizers needed a technical report covering my full month’s work. And yes, that report was a big deal; it affects my score heavily.

Here’s the kicker: I had no idea how technical writing should be conducted. I’d read a bunch of papers before, so I had a gut feeling about how it should look, but no real experience. I was stressing out, then, at the last minute, I came up with an idea that saved me: use AI to write an AI report (lol).

## Set Up

Big thanks to my friend Saber for some previous discussions—they really helped me here. He suggested I send the whole competition description in several files and feed it to AI Studio, so I did that. I thought it’d help a lot because the AI could understand my task better. And in practice, it worked really well! The chatbot could predict what I’d done and what the competition hosts expected in the report, even though I hadn’t talked about it yet. It covered the gaps in my report and suggested some adjustments really well.

After feeding it all the competition details, I decided to use a human-in-the-loop technique. Basically, I made AI Studio the writer for me (completely), and I’d feed it what it needed. I started by giving the AI a short description of what I had done and what I wanted included in the report. I also told it I’d send more details about my work as I went, and it should incorporate and refine this information into the report for me.

Here’s how it went: I asked AI Studio to suggest a layout for the report. I changed it a little to fit my work, and we settled on a structure. Then the AI asked me for detailed content for each section. I gave it my full work, section by section.

> Not gonna lie, this was a headache right here—I had to recall everything I did in a month in just 2 hours!

Going section by section helped, and the AI could sort the content, so I didn’t need to feed it in sequential order. It was a lifesaver!

## The Results

Even though I had to recall everything in just 2 hours, I somehow fed AI Studio all the content I wanted to report to the competition hosts. And you know what? AI Studio didn’t fail me. It produced a full report with everything I needed, using really precise and scientific words I couldn’t come up with :v. It was exactly what I wanted, even with my limited English. Plus, it shortened my messy 15-page draft to 10 pages, cutting redundant parts and polished the sentences effectively.

After that, I asked AI Studio to generate the LaTeX code, made a few manual changes, and the report was complete. I submitted it just 2 minutes before the deadline. But it looked professional and legitimate.

## Conclusion

AI Studio saved me this time, and I think I’ll give it more tries for technical writing—with a larger time period, lol. It was a game-changer for getting a technical report done fast, especially for a newbie like me. I’m pretty excited to keep using it, and I bet other researchers would find it handy too. 

There’s one drawback, though: it doesn’t handle image integration well. I haven’t tried it enough, so I can’t say for sure, but I’ll definitely experiment with images later. 

You definitely should try it yourself and see how it works for you! This is the end of the post, hope you learn something useful today and don’t be shy to share your use case below :)
